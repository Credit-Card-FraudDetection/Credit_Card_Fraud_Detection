# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In the present world, one of the major problem is credit card fraud detection. The importance of detecting fraudulent activities during transactions have been a big trouble for the credit card companies. It costs individuals and financial institutions billions of dollars annually. This project demonstrates various algorithms we can use to detect the fraudulent transactions. Today, we have many machine learning algorithms that can help us classify abnormal transactions. The only requirement is the past data and the precise machine learning algorithm. 

## Classification Models
The credit card fraud detection is a binary classification problem.The algorithms we used are 
#### K-Nearest Neighbours 
#### Logistic Regression 
#### Support Vector Machine 
#### Decision Trees 
#### Random Forest

The evaluation metrics used in this model are 
#### ROC Curve plot based on Confusion Matrix 

#### F1 Score-![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106539489/171011945-6b85831a-800a-4c14-99fc-cf8a952ac5ae.png)
